# Ai-Colab-MedStar

## Internship Experience at MedStar Health AI CoLab

**Goal:***
Apply machine learning to clinical datasets to investigate maternal and cardiometabolic health outcomes, with an emphasis on health disparities and predictive modeling.

**Projects Overview**
This repository contains multiple research projects completed during my internships at MedStar Health’s AI CoLab.

Focus areas include:
- Maternal and cardiovascular health
- Preeclampsia risk factors
- Kidney function and β-cell dysfunction
- Type 2 diabetes prediction

**Data**
- **Sources:** Clinical datasets and NHANES
- **Features:** Demographics, biomarkers (eGFR, BUN), socioeconomic indicators, family history
- **Challenges:** Missing data, class imbalance, feature correlation

**Methods**
- Models:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost
    - LightGBM

- Techniques:
    - Data cleaning & preprocessing
    - Feature engineering
    - Model comparison
    - Performance evaluation (R², feature importance)

**Key Results**
- Best model: Random Forest
- Performance: R² = 0.85
- Important predictors:
    - eGFR
    - BUN
    - Albumin-to-creatinine ratio
    - Age

**Socioeconomic status**
- Tools & Technologies
    - Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
    - matplotlib / seaborn
    - Jupyter Notebook

**Limitations & Future Work**
- Expand subgroup bias analysis
- External dataset validation

Explore calibration and interpretability methods (e.g., SHAP)
